# How fast do eclipses travel?

Total solar eclipses are really impressive. In a total eclipse, the Sun is completelly blocked off by the moon, which makes some spectacular views, as the sky turns dark, stars and planets become visible during the day and the solar corona becomes also visible, with an out-of-this-world look.

The 2024 North American solar eclipse lasted about 3 minutes, which is essentially given by the speed at which the Moon's shardow travels over the surface of the Earth. How fast does the eclipse travel?

To estimate the speed of an eclipse, one can take two points with known eclipse times, and use the distance to estimate an average speed.

The NY Times, has [posted the times](https://www.nytimes.com/article/total-solar-eclipse.html?smid=url-share) at which the eclipse was predicted to happen for a few cities in the US, which we can take for this calculation.

From the table above, we can see that the totality of the eclipse happens in Dallas at 1:40pm Central Time, and it reaches Rochester NY at 3:20pm. Given NY is one hour ahead Dallas, the time taken to cross from these two cities is 40 minutes.

The distance from Dallas to Rochester is roughly 2000 km according to Google maps.

Dividing both, the speed of the eclipse is 2000km/40min = 3000km/h = 1864 mi/h. Which is fast! How fast? roughly [1.4 times the speed of the Concorde](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=2000km%2F40min).
